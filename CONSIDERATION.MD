Problem solving consideration process:
===

###First: Briefly understand
The first time I got this exam, I must understand the EER and NER 
technology. I read some paper about the technology (because I have 
not have much exposure to NLP).

[Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)

[Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03814.pdf)

[Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf)

###Second: Training & Test
Find related codes and models according to the requirements of the company.

[NER](https://github.com/Determined22/zh-NER-TF)

[EER](https://github.com/crownpku/Information-Extraction-Chinese/tree/master/RE_BGRU_2ATT)

Configure the code and complete the result recording.

###Third: Models and technologies introduction   


###Fourth: Result analysis


###Fifth: Future directions for improvement
I consider that NLP use LSTM(or GRU) technology, so we can add an attention
 mechanism for getting more semantic information. Because in the process,
 the information is getting less and less, we should try the best to get more
 semantic information. This is a sample method, a very clever idea.
